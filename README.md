# mini-msg-board
A simple Node.js and Express app that lets users post and view messages in a minimal message board format. Initially built to practice server-side rendering and form handling with EJS, this project has been enhanced with persistent data storage using PostgreSQL and the pg library. It is fully deployed with a hosted PostgreSQL database to ensure robust functionality.
